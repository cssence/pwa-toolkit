# The Original @cssence Toolbox

What started as a toolbox for html/css/js (focusing on CSS viewport units) is now my full-fledged progressive web app toolkit.

## Build

This is a zero-dependency project, without any build step. However, you need to serve the `public` folder. Any http-server will do, e.g.

```shell
npm install http-server
./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server public/
```
